//  do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop run at least once.
// so, do...while loop first will 'do' one pass of the code inside the loop and then it runs 'while' a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
// 

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

 do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10) ;
