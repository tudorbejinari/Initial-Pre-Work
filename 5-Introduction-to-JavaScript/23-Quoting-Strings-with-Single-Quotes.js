// First of all the backsplash (\) should not be confused with the forward slash/
// In Javascript you have an option to keep the quotes for example double quotes in a string only if you start and end with single quotes and no (\) need it anymore.As I used in the example below
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
