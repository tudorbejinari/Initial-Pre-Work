// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "incredibly frustrating, but highly rewarding!"; //This is totally true!
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
