// to find nth character in a string use bracket notation[n]. In our example the third letter will be 2nd character because you start counting at 0.
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
